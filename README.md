# Project Title (H1)
**Develope an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze key workforce metrics and uncover attrition trends within the organization.**

**Projet Desciption:**
The project focused on major KPIs including:
1. overall attrition rate
2. attrition by gender
3. education field and job role
4. average employee age distribution.

**Processes followed:**
Executed comprehensive data preparation involving dataset import, data cleaning, column standardization, table merging, and null value management to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

**Key insights and action plan:**
1. Employees aged 18–35 exhibited a higher attrition rate (21.9%) compared to the organization’s average of 16.1%. Based on these findings, strategic recommendations were proposed to enhance work-life balance and career growth opportunities, particularly for the 25–34 age group in the R&D department.
2. Majority of the attrition is taking place in the 1st work year experience. To prevent this it is recommended to implement buddy/mentor programs, team meet‑and‑greets, and cross‑functional touchpoints to create early belonging and social support that correlate with lower early attrition.
3. Sales representative, Laboratory Technician and Research Scientists are the top 3 job reles with lowest average salaries and having high attrition rate.This indicates the requirement for special steps that need to take towards salary revison for the employees of this department.

**Conclusion:**
By leveraging Power BI’s visualization capabilities, the project transformed raw HR data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making, improved retention strategies, and continuous performance monitoring.
